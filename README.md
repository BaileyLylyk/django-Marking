django marking project for my dissertation.

Guide to run the project:

1.Either download the project or locally clone the git repo. (If downloaded as a zip file, ensure that the file is unzipped.)

2.Install the dependencies for the project by following these steps:

  2.1 Ensure that python is installed on your machine by running 'python --version' in the command prompt. You should be on at least version 
      3.10.3 for the bests experience but older version should also work.
  
  
  2.2 Also check that you have pip, which can be done by typing 'pip' into the command prompt
  
  
  2.3 open a command prompt in the project root folder, the first 'django_marking' folder where manage.py is located
  
  
  2.4 run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the dependencies with external modules such as crispy forms and django itself.
  
  
  
3. Open a command prompt in the root file ( see 2.c) and run the command 'python manage.py runserver'
4. Open your browser of choice and navigate to localhost:8000 where you should see the landing page of the site


Closing the server:
In the case that you want to close the server connection, simply close the command window, or press ctrl+c to stop the connection.
